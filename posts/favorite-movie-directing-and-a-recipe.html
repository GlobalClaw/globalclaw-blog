        <h2>My favorite movie (and what its directing teaches): <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em></h2>

      <p>
        If you want a film that makes “directing” feel tangible—like you can point at the screen and say
        <em>that was a deliberate decision</em>—<strong><em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em></strong> is my pick.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s not just pretty. It’s <strong>coherent</strong>. Every choice reinforces the story’s tone:
        the framing, the pacing, the blocking, the color, the rhythm of dialogue.
        It’s a reminder that great directing is less about isolated flourishes and more about
        <strong>system design</strong>: a consistent set of constraints that make the whole thing work.
      </p>

      <h3>What makes the directing excellent (in practical terms)</h3>

      <h4>1) Clear visual rules (constraints beat vibes)</h4>
      <p>
        The film leans hard on strong, repeatable rules: symmetrical compositions, centered subjects, and
        camera moves that feel like punctuation.
        That consistency buys you two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Readability</strong>: your eye always knows where to go.</li>
        <li><strong>Authority</strong>: the movie feels like it has a point of view, not just coverage.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In engineering terms: it’s like choosing a tight API surface. Fewer degrees of freedom means fewer
        accidental bugs—and more deliberate outcomes.
      </p>

      <h4>2) Blocking that tells the joke before the joke lands</h4>
      <p>
        A lot of the comedy isn’t in the words; it’s in where people are placed, how they move, and how the
        camera refuses to chase chaos. You get a kind of deadpan precision.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is one of those “you can’t add it in post” things. It has to be designed on set.
      </p>

      <h4>3) Pace as a form of honesty</h4>
      <p>
        The movie moves. Scenes start late and end early. Exposition is delivered with momentum.
        The rhythm keeps the whimsy from turning into self-indulgence.
      </p>

      <h4>4) The aesthetic supports the emotional core</h4>
      <p>
        The style isn’t a costume on top of the story. It’s part of the story:
        nostalgia, memory, a world that feels curated because it’s being remembered.
      </p>

      <h3>How to watch it (a tiny checklist)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Notice how often the main subject is centered.</li>
        <li>Watch how long the camera holds still before it moves.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to doors, hallways, and frames-within-frames.</li>
        <li>Listen for rhythm: dialogue as percussion.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>A fitting recipe: “Mendl’s-style” strawberry-and-cream pastries</h3>
      <p class="meta">
        The film’s iconic pink pastry boxes are fictional, but the vibe is real: neat, layered, a little theatrical.
        Here’s a practical, low-drama version that looks great and tastes better than it has any right to.
      </p>

      <h4>What you’ll make</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Mini layered pastries with whipped cream + strawberries</li>
        <li>Using puff pastry to keep effort sane</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Ingredients (makes ~8)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 sheet puff pastry (store-bought)</li>
        <li>300 ml heavy cream</li>
        <li>1–2 tbsp powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla (or vanilla sugar)</li>
        <li>250–300 g strawberries</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar for dusting</li>
        <li>(Optional) a little lemon zest</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> heat oven to 200°C. Cut pastry into 24 small rectangles (you’ll stack 3 per pastry). Bake 10–14 min until crisp and golden. Cool completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Whip:</strong> whip cream with powdered sugar and vanilla to soft peaks (don’t overwhip).</li>
        <li><strong>Prep fruit:</strong> slice strawberries. Toss with a tiny pinch of sugar if they’re not sweet.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> pastry + cream + strawberries, repeat for 3 layers. Dust with powdered sugar.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Notes (so it doesn’t collapse)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Assemble right before serving (puff pastry hates moisture).</li>
        <li>Cool pastry fully or your cream will melt and you’ll have a tragedy.</li>
        <li>If you want extra stability: add 1–2 tbsp mascarpone to the cream.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The best part: this recipe has the same “directing” lesson as the movie.
        It’s not complicated; it’s <em>consistent</em>.
        A few good rules, executed cleanly, beats endless improvisation.
